Expose deep learning models on a Coral usb accelerator via a Flask app. To run the app and expose over a network: 
```
$ python3 coral-app.py
```
Then use curl to query:
```
curl -X POST -F image=@images/test-image3.jpg 'http://localhost:5000/v1/vision/detection'

{'predictions': [{'confidence': 0.953125,
   'label': 'person',
   'x_max': 918,
   'x_min': 838,
   'y_max': 407,
   'y_min': 135},
  {'confidence': 0.58203125,
   'label': 'person',
   'x_max': 350,
   'x_min': 226,
   'y_max': 374,
   'y_min': 143}]
 'success': True}
```

To see the help run:
```
$ python3 coral-app.py -h
```

See the [coral-app-usage.ipynb](https://github.com/robmarkcole/coral-pi-rest-server/blob/master/coral-app-usage.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for usage from python.

## Pi setup
Install one of the disk images from [edgetpu-platforms](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu-platforms). In the `/home/pi` directory `git clone` this repository. You wil now have a file stucture like (pi3 &pi4 only, pi-zero [differs](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu-platforms/issues/13)):
```
$ ls

all_models  coral-pi-rest-server  edgetpu_api  examples-camera  project-posenet  project-teachable  simple-demo
```

Use the `cd` command to enter `~/simple-demo` and test you installation:
```
pi@pi:~/simple-demo $ python3 classify_image.py --model /home/pi/all_models/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_inat_bird_quant_edgetpu.tflite --label  /home/pi/all_models/inat_bird_labels.txt --image  parrot.jpg

Assuming you saw the result above, use the `cd` command to enter `~/coral-pi-rest-server` and (system wide, no viretual environment) install the required dependencies:
```
~/coral-pi-rest-server $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Now run the app:
```
~/coral-pi-rest-server $ python3 coral-app.py
```
### Service
You can run the app as a [service](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/systemd.md). Edit `coral.service` file to fit your needs and copy into `/etc/systemd/system` as root using `sudo cp coral.service /etc/systemd/system/coral.service`. Once this has been copied, you can attempt to start the service using `sudo systemctl start coral.service`. See the status and logs with `sudo systemctl status coral.service`. Stop the service with `sudo systemctl stop coral.service`. You can have it start automatically on reboot by using `sudo systemctl enable coral.service`.

### Pi 3
I am running a pi3 with the raspi camera below. FYI the camera is mounted on a [pan-tilt stage](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pan-tilt-hat).

</p>

Using the pi3 (which has only usb2) processing a single request from another machine via this server takes ~ 300 to 500 ms. Therefore this is certainly fast enough to process images at 1 FPS which in my experience is suitable for tasks such as counting people in a room.

### Pi 4
The pi4 has USB3 so we would expect better speeds. However I get inference time consistently ~ 500 ms when querying from another machine. Therefore it appears the coral library does not yet take advantage of the USB3.

## Pi-zero
Pi zero disk image differs from the pi3 and pi4 images. To check your pi-zero disk image run:
```
~/simple-demo $ python3 classify_image.py \
 --model models/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_inat_bird_quant_edgetpu.tflite \
 --label models/inat_bird_labels.txt \
 --image parrot.jpg

To install flask I had to `sudo pip3 install flask` as attempts using `requirements.txt` kept timing out. Also since the directory structure is different on the pi-zero, in `coral-app.py` you need to edit:
```
MODELS_DIR = "/home/pi/simple-demo/models/"
```
I found that I get inference time in the range 2.5 to 5s when querying from another machine, so significantly slower than the pi3/pi4.

## Power
I recommend using a power supply which can supply 3 Amps, [I use this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B017YW2CKM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Note that the official RPI supply delivers only 2.5 Amp and I found this was causing an issue where the stick would 'go to sleep' after a day of continual use.

## Models
If you have installed the raspberry pi disk images from edgetpu-platforms then you already have all the models in `home/pi/all_models`. If you are using a linux desktop you will need to download the models.
* The official pre-compiled models are at -> https://coral.withgoogle.com/models/
* It is [also possible to train your own models](https://coral.withgoogle.com/tutorials/edgetpu-models-intro/) -> try using Google Colaboratory as the free environment for training or -> https://cloud-annotations.github.io/training/object-detection/cli/index.html

## No coral?
I created a fork of this project that does not require a Coral at https://github.com/robmarkcole/tensorflow-lite-rest-server

## Deepstack & Home Assistant
The data returned by the app is as close as possible in format to that returned by Deepstack object detection endpoint, allowing you to use this app as the backend for [HASS-Deepstack-object](https://github.com/robmarkcole/HASS-Deepstack-object)

## Troubleshooting
-----------------------------
Q: I get the error: `HandleQueuedBulkIn transfer in failed. Not found: USB transfer error 5 [LibUsbDataInCallback]`
A: I reflashed the SD card and tried again with success
